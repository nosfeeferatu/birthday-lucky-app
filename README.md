## Is Your Birthday Lucky?

A React app that takes your birthday and your lucky number and checks if they go together to make your birthdate lucky. It does this by taking the sum of all the digits of the date and calculating its modulus with your lucky number. If the modulus results in zero, your birthday is lucky.
